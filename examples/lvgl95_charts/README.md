# LVGL Chart Gallery

**Requires WebScreen firmware 4.0 (LVGL 9.5 compatible).**

Curve, line, bar, and scatter charts with two live synthetic signals. Designed for the 536 × 240 display; no Wi-Fi, external assets, or custom configuration needed.

## Install

In [WebScreen Admin](https://admin.webscreen.cc), open **Apps**, search for **LVGL Chart Gallery**, and install it. Admin saves `lvgl95_charts.js` and makes it the startup app.

To try it without changing your startup app, upload `script.js` as `lvgl95_charts.js` with the Serial IDE, then run:

```text
/load lvgl95_charts.js
```

Wait for `DEMO READY:` before sending another command. Keep your existing `webscreen.json`; `app.json` is the app manifest and is not a replacement for your device settings.

## Controls and checks

- **Short press:** Curve → line → bar → scatter → paused.
- **Long press:** power off, as usual.
- In the serial console, `/eval demo_button(1);` also advances the mode.

Compare all four chart types. Scatter points should remain unconnected when the data wraps. Use `/errors` and `/stats` to inspect runtime health; `/screenshot` captures the display. The animation uses one timer and reuses its objects and styles.
